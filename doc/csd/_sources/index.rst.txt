Welcome to CSD
===============

If you arrived at this page because you clicked the hyperlink in the ``README.rst`` file, then you might have already read most of the :doc:`introduction` page. If not, read that first; it explains what CSD is, and that it is made up of several different libraries.

Each library has its own documentation, which you can access via the "table of contents" links at the top of this page, or by using the navigation bar on the left. You can click the CSD logo at any time to return to this landing page.

Enjoy!
